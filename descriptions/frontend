Commands Working so Far
=======================

create table <tableName> (col1=type1, col2=type2, ...)
create index <columnName> on <tableName>
drop table <tableName>
drop index <indexName> on <tableName>
drop attribute <attributeName> from <tableName>
load <tableName> <fileName>
print <tableName>
print attributes <tableName>
help <commandName>
help
quit or exit



Language for Query Engine
=========================  
[] means 0 or 1
{} means 0 or more

column-name   := "string"
table-name    := "string"
aggregate     := MIN | MAX | AVG | COUNT | SUM
operation     := "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" | "=" | "!="
value         := "TypeVarChar" | "TypeInt" | "TypeReal"
method        := "SCAN" | INDEX"

column-list := "*" | aggregateOp | (column-name {"," column-name}) // check this out
aggregateOp 	:= aggregate "(" column-name ")"
table-list    := table-name {"," table-name}

expression    := column-name | value
cond-seq      := cond { ("and" | "or") cond}
cond          := column-name operation expression

select        := "SELECT" column-list "FROM" table-list ["WHERE" cond-seq] ["GROUPBY" column-list]

// these two were in Mike's email
join          := (method, select, select, cond-seq)
//agg (kind, method, query-expr, groupcol1, groupcol2, ..)

Example Queries
---------------
filter: "SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE sal > 600000"
project: "SELECT NAME FROM EMP"
join: "SELECT * FROM EMP, JOB WHERE EMP.JID = JOB.JID"
SELECT MAX(sal) FROM EMP
SELECT city, MAX(sal) FROM emp GROUP BY city

query =
      FILTER <attr> <op> <value> FROM <query>
      PROJECT <attrs> FROM <query>
      JOIN <lattr> <op> <rattr> FROM {"INL" <query1>, <query2-Index> | "NL" <query1>, <query2>}
      AGG <OP>(query) OF <attr> [GROUPBY <attr>]
      tableName | indexName

QUERY FILTER sal > 600000 FROM EMP
QUERY PROJECT name FROM EMP
QUERY JOIN jid = jid FROM "NL" EMP, JOB
QUERY AGG MAX(PROJECT sal FROM EMP)
QUERY AGG MAX(PROJECT city, sal FROM EMP) OF sal GROUPBY city

query = 
      FILTER { "(" <query> ")" } WHERE <attr> <op> <value> 
      PROJECT { "(" <query> ")" } GET "[" <attrs> "]"
      JOIN <lattr> <op> <rattr> FROM {"INL" <query1>, <query2-Index> | "NL" <query1>, <query2>}
      AGG <OP>(query) OF <attr> [GROUPBY <attr>]
      tableName | indexName
